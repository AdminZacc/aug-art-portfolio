# 🌅 Tomorrow Morning Checklist (August 9, 2025)

## 🎯 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ Admin panel CRUD functions enhanced with debugging
- ✅ Supabase storage bucket 'artworks' exists and is public
- ⏳ Storage policies need to be configured
- ⏳ Upload/CRUD functionality ready for final testing

### **Priority Tasks (30 minutes max):**

#### **1. Configure Storage Policies (10 min)**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage → Policies
- Create 4 policies for 'artworks' bucket:
  - Public read access
  - Authenticated upload/update/delete
- OR try setting bucket to fully public in Storage settings

#### **2. Test Upload Functionality (10 min)**
- Open admin panel: https://adminzacc.github.io/aug-art-portfolio/admin.html
- Go to Upload tab
- Upload test artwork
- Check console for debugging output

#### **3. Test CRUD Operations (10 min)**
- Go to Gallery tab (after successful upload)
- Click "Edit" on artwork
- Test update functionality
- Test delete functionality
- Run `testCRUD()` in console if issues

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Upload shows progress and success message
- ✅ Artworks appear in gallery
- ✅ Edit modal opens and saves changes
- ✅ Delete removes artwork from gallery

### **If Issues Occur:**
- Check browser console for detailed debugging output
- Look for ❌/✅ status indicators in console logs
- Verify authentication state with session info

### **Files Ready:**
- `admin.js` - Enhanced with comprehensive CRUD debugging
- `supabase-setup.sql` - Storage policies script (if needed)
- All changes deployed to GitHub Pages

## 🚀 **Next Steps After CRUD Works:**
1. Add sample artworks for demonstration
2. Document setup process for other users
3. Optimize performance and add advanced features
